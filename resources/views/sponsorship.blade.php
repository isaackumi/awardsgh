<p>
  The National Communications Awards provides a platform to recognize individuals and companies that play a significant role in the growth and development of the media industry while recognising the key functions within the media industry that promote growth and sustainability. All sponsorships include participation in the exhibition prior to Awards
We are committed to supporting the development of business relationships and we will make every effort to promote this aim when we partner with you in a sponsorship. Your firm will have top priority in terms of time, exposure and opportunity before, during and after the events. The event offers you and your company the opportunity to market yourself and build image awareness as well as gain maximum exposure by becoming a sponsor of these events.
During the exhibition and Awards Gala, we aim to create a professional business atmosphere, which provides guests and sponsors, with a comfortable and relaxing environment in which they can develop the contacts that lead to future transactions and long-term alliances.
